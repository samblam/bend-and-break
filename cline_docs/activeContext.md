# Active Context: Bend & Break

## Current Focus
We are currently in the initial setup phase of the Bend & Break project. The focus is on implementing the ultra-lean MVP version as described in the GDD and TDD, which includes:

1. Creating a basic scene with a 5x5 white plane
2. Implementing a single ragdoll arm with two segments (upper and lower)
3. Setting up a static dummy target (single torso block)
4. Implementing time control mechanics (slow motion/resolve)
5. Creating button-based controls for joint manipulation (gesture controls deferred to full version)
6. Implementing hit detection and win condition

## Recent Changes
- Created initial project documentation (GDD.md and TDD.md)
- Set up Memory Bank documentation structure
- Defined the scope of the MVP version

## Next Steps
1. **Hours 1-2**: Set up the basic scene, arm, and dummy using Three.js and Ammo.js
   - Create the 3D scene with plane, camera, and lighting
   - Implement the ragdoll arm with proper physics constraints
   - Add the static dummy with collision detection

2. **Hours 3-4**: Implement controls, time manipulation, and hit detection
   - Create button UI for joint angle adjustments
   - Implement time control system (idle, adjusting with TimeScale = 0.1, resolving states)
   - Add hit detection logic for arm-dummy collisions

3. **Hours 5-6**: Finalize win condition, UI feedback, and testing
   - Implement win condition (dummy torso top hits floor, y < 0)
   - Add visual feedback (arm turns red on hit, dummy flashes on hit)
   - Test and debug physics interactions

4. **Buffer (0-1 Hour)**: Fix any remaining physics bugs or issues

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring physics interactions work correctly with time manipulation
- Creating responsive controls that work well on mobile devices
- Optimizing performance to maintain 30+ FPS on mid-tier mobile devices
- Balancing the difficulty of knocking over the dummy

## Development Timeline
The entire MVP is planned to be completed within 1 day (6-8 hours) to meet the game jam requirements.
