# Progress Tracking: Bend & Break

## Project Status
**Current Phase**: Initial Setup / Planning
**Timeline**: 1 Day Development (6-8 Hours)
**Target Completion**: March 18, 2025
**Game Jam Submission Deadline**: March 25, 2025

## What Works
- âœ… Project documentation created (GDD.md, TDD.md)
- âœ… Memory Bank documentation established

## What's In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Setting up the development environment
- ðŸ”„ Planning the implementation approach

## What's Left to Build

### Core Systems
- [ ] Three.js scene setup
  - [ ] 5x5 white plane
  - [ ] Camera and lighting
  - [ ] WebGL renderer configuration
- [ ] Ammo.js physics world
  - [ ] Gravity and collision configuration
  - [ ] Ground plane physics body

### Ragdoll Arm
- [ ] Upper arm segment
  - [ ] Visual mesh
  - [ ] Physics rigid body
  - [ ] Shoulder joint constraint
- [ ] Lower arm segment
  - [ ] Visual mesh
  - [ ] Physics rigid body
  - [ ] Elbow joint constraint

### Dummy Target
- [ ] Single torso block visual mesh
- [ ] Physics rigid body
- [ ] Collision detection

### Time Control
- [ ] Idle state (TimeScale = 0)
- [ ] Adjusting state (TimeScale = 0.1)
- [ ] Resolving state (TimeScale = 1)
- [ ] State transitions

### Controls
- [ ] Upper arm +10Â° button
- [ ] Upper arm -10Â° button
- [ ] Lower arm +10Â° button
- [ ] Lower arm -10Â° button
- [ ] Commit button
- [ ] Button event handling

### Game Logic
- [ ] Hit detection (velocity â‰¥5 m/s)
- [ ] Force application (velocity * 10 N)
- [ ] Win condition check (dummy torso top y < 0)
- [ ] Game reset on win

### Visual Feedback
- [ ] Arm color change on hit
- [ ] Dummy flash on hit
- [ ] Win notification

### Optimization
- [ ] Performance testing on mobile
- [ ] FPS optimization if needed
- [ ] Touch input refinement

## Development Milestones

### Hours 1-2: Scene, Arm, Dummy Setup
- [ ] Create basic Three.js scene
- [ ] Implement Ammo.js physics world
- [ ] Add arm segments with joint constraints
- [ ] Add dummy with physics properties

### Hours 3-4: Controls, Time, Hit Detection
- [ ] Create button UI (gesture controls deferred to full version)
- [ ] Implement time control system (TimeScale = 0.1 during adjustments)
- [ ] Add joint manipulation logic
- [ ] Implement hit detection

### Hours 5-6: Win Condition, UI, Testing
- [ ] Add win condition check (dummy torso top y < 0)
- [ ] Implement visual feedback (arm turns red on hit, dummy flashes)
- [ ] Test physics interactions
- [ ] Optimize for mobile

### Buffer (0-1 Hour): Bug Fixes
- [ ] Address any physics issues
- [ ] Fix UI problems
- [ ] Final testing

## Known Issues
- None yet - development not started

## Next Actions
1. Set up the development environment
2. Create the basic HTML/CSS structure
3. Initialize Three.js scene
4. Begin implementing the physics system
